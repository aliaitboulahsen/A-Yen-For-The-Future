# A Yen For The Future

The financial departments of large companies often have to make foreign currency transactions when doing international business, while hedge funds are also interested in anything that will provide an edge in predicting currency movements. Hence, both are always eager to gain a better understanding of the future direction and risk of various currencies.
In this activitty, I will use different time series tools in order to predict future movements in the value of the Canadian dollar versus the Japanese yen.

## We will be working with different models such:

-Autoregressive Moving Average Model

-Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average

-Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity

-Seasonal Effects with Sklearn Linear Regression

## There will be two code files for this analysis: 

Time series forecasting

Linear regression modelling
